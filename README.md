## Hello, I'm Lucca 👋

### About me

I'm a Software Engineer with 5+ years of industry experience, seeking to transition back to technical roles after 4 years as a Product Designer.

I began my career as a software developer, but I was driven by a desire to gain a deeper understanding of the product development process, and I believed the best way to achieve this was through hands-on experience in design.

Even before making this transition, I had a solid foundation in design skills, particularly with graphic design tools like Photoshop.

Now that I've enhanced these skills and increased my knowledge in product development, which includes a sharp eye for UI design, I'm currently studying to specialize in frontend development.

### Education
- Postgraduate degree (Lato sensu) in <strong>Full Stack Development</strong> (2024-2025) from Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (PUC Minas)
- Bachelor of Science in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> (2018-2022) from Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (PUC Minas)
- I speak English :uk:, Portuguese :brazil:, and Spanish :es:
